## Key Algorithms

### ROI Calculation
```
ROI = (Goals × Position Weight) +
      (Assists × 5) +
      (Clean Sheet Bonus) +
      (Minutes Played Bonus) +
      (Rating Bonus) -
      (Card Penalties)
```

### Price Update
```
Price Change = ROI × 0.5 × (1 + Popularity Factor)
New Price = Current Price + Price Change (min $50)
```

### Portfolio Value
```
Portfolio Value = Σ (Player Current Price × Quantity)
Total Wealth = Portfolio Value + Cash Balance
ROI = ((Current Value - Invested) / Invested) × 100
```
